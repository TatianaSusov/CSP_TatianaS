        /<p>So far I have really enjoyed this class. It is at a great level and I'm always learning something new. I like having the ability to create things such as websites from scratch so this is really fun. I enjoyed the programming unit because I got to learn how to cod ethings such as games and calculators which could be hlepful in the future. I also hae nejoye the internet unit so far, I basically already knew how to use HTML and CSS but I forgot a lot of things so I have been able to recall all those cool things and increase my knowledge. I like being able to make things work on a computer and I would love to be able to teach my little brother how to code like this if he is ever interested. So far I am really enjoying this class, I'm glad that I'm taking it. </p>
