        <h3> What is crocheting?/How do you do it?</h3>
        <p> Crocheting is a creative activity that anyone who is up to the challenge can do. It involves using a hook placed in one hand (sizes may very based off of the yarn you use and how you want things to look) and then athread of yarn in the other hand. To begin basic crocheting you first have to make a slip knot. After that step is done you place your hook in the loop and wrap the long end of the yarn over (to begin this it is smart to have a firm hold on the short end of the yarn so that your work looks neater). Afterwards you pull the original loop over the new loop and off the hook, now you have made a chain link!<br> Once you have that first link it is pretty easy from there. Based off of the pattern you may be using you'll have to crochet a certain amount of chain links creating a chain. Once your chain has been made add two extra links then start crocheting backwards an extra row on top of the chain you created. to do this you dip your hook into the first loop (keep in mind you still have a single loop all the time throughout the crocheting process), then you wrap one loop of yarn over your hook and remove the bottom two loops. This starts the beginning of a new row and from there you can continue to the end of the row and repeat the process of crocheting two extra loops then strting the next row. <br> After doing this for a little bit you should have a nice looking rag of some sort if you're starting small, or if you decided to go big for your first project you may end up with a blanket or something. <br><br>Congratulations! You have now crocheted something!<br> Good Job!

        <h3>How I got started</h3>
        <p>When I was at a young age (probably around 9 or something), my mom decided to teach me how to crochet. Because I was young and I am left handed and my mom is right handed, it was dificult for me to learn how to crochet. She had tried to teach me how to crochet left handed but it was very difficult for her and we eventually gave up. A few years later when I was older and more interested, I saw my friend crocheting and it actually looked really easy so I decided to try again, this time right handed. Although I do it a little weirdly, I have been successful in learning how to crochet. I have been able to branch out and learn new techniques to make my work even more interesting to look at, and even functional. I'm still learning to this day, I have a few big projects I'm working on right now and one includes a technique that I'm still not familiar with.<br>It does make my hand hurt sometimes but I have enjoyed my crocheting journey so far and I can't wait to learn more!</p>
