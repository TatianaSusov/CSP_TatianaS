        <h2> My overall passion/thing I like</h2>
        <h5>In relation to things I already like and how things connect.</h5>
        <p> I basically love knowledge, I love learning new things and exploring the world around me. I've been able to do so any cool thing such as hiking where I can learn history and orserve the nature around me. Or I can read a book and learn new facts, words and experience new experiences through stories without having to leave my room! I can also gain knowledge from drawing. I have learned how to draw more realistically and have learned about conveying messages and how different drawings can convey different messages. I love learning and exploring the world around me even if half the time I do it from the comforts of my home.</p>
