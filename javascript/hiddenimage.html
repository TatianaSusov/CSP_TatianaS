        <p>Dogs are fluffy loveable companions that if treated right will be your best friend for eternity. No matter the breed or age, you have the ability to become best friends with any dog you come across, even the ones that may not like you at first. You just have to know the right way to get on their good side, and when you do, you'll have a best friend for life!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dogs aren't only just a pleasureable companion, but they can also serve specific purposes. Many can be therapy dogs specially trained to comfort people, or they could be police dogs trained to sniff out drugs, or guide dogs for the blind, or disease detecting dogs. Dogs can do many things, even just based off of their sense of smell. Some dogs have a stronger sense of smell than otehrs but any dog can have the ability to identify strong smells.</p>
